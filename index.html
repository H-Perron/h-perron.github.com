                <p><img src="images/photo.png" alt="photo" class="alignleft">Hi! I am currently a student at Sierra College. I hope to one day design websites as a job, and if you're looking for an employee, I do accept payment in sprinkles (as long as they're the long kind).</p>
                <p>I made this page when I learned about Git from my professor, but I'll likely be back to update it in the future when I'm ready to start working on projects professionally.</p>
